# Online shopping intention analysis

From a dataset that consists of statistical characteristics of about 12,000 sessions on online sales websites, I carried out an analysis of the purchase intention that a person could have in a virtual way and how we could predict the behavior of users. This [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset) was created and hosted in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. With this project I seek to apply Mavhine Learning algorithms to perform data analysis and predict behaviors according to the analysis.

## Features

  * Clustering by [K-Means](https://towardsdatascience.com/k-means-explained-10349949bd10#:~:text=The%20elbow%20method%20uses%20the,we%20see%20an%20inflection%20point.)
